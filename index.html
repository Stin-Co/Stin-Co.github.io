      Stinco is a small indie company producing a game named "Project 3".
      Project 3 will feature expansive open world gameplay with immersive sim
      elements. Stinco prides itself on the extreme realism featured in
      Project 3's various gameplay sytems.<br>
      <br>
      Project 3 will provide an extremely customizable user experience,
      allowing the player to dial in each element of the game to their liking.
      Some things in Project 3 that will be fully modifiable include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Mechanically accurate guns that can be dissassembled and upgraded
      </li>
      <li>
        Customizable ammunition types and materials that players can arrange
        into magazines as they please
      </li>
      <li>
        A modular armor system that allows players to design their armor
      </li>
      <li>Modifiable vehichles, bases, and programmable robots</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The game world, influenced by dieselpunk and sci-fi, will take place in
      an already established universe created by Stinco's founder. The events
      of the story will take place in real time, and will happen whether the
      player is there to experience them or not. The story will react to what
      you choose to do throughout the games runtime.
